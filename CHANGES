[v1.2 20050826]

* Release

[v1.1 20050726]

* Release

[v1.0 - 20050501]

* First version

* Introduced a helper portal tool to improve configurability and logic
  handling. (06/12/05)

* Now siteadmins can setup more than one MountFolder at the root of the portal
  (no more hardcoding of 'content'). (06/14/05)

* Fixed Selenium tests (06/15/05)

* Fixed a bug with copy-pasting an ATDocument called 'index_html' within a 
  MountFolder-based content branch. Some code using ReplaceableWrapper 
  (see CMFPlone/PloneFolder) was copied from ATCT. (08/26/05)

* Added normal unit tests, specifically related to the above mentioned bug.
  Thx to Nicolas Geissel. (08/26/05)
